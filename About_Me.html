    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>Hi my name is Dwayne McPherson, and I'm a 16 year-old who loves playing the piano, 
        spending time with my family, 
        and helping my teachers and classmates whenever I can. 
        I'm passionate about computers and programming, 
        and I enjoy expessing my creativity through drawing. 
        I'm always curious, eager to learn new things, and excited about exploring the world of techology and art.</p>
